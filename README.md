Diabetes prediction Machine Learning Model

**Project Title:** Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

**Description:**
A machine learning model to predict the onset of diabetes based on a patient's diagnostic measurements. 
This was developed as part of my internship at IndoSkill, Aqmenz Pvt Ltd.

**Dataset:** diabetes.csv

**Methodology:** 
The project aims to predict diabetes using Logistic Regression. 
Practical implementation of logistic regression using various functions of python programming language.

**Results:**
Achieved 85% accuracy with the Logistic Regression model.

**Technologies Used:**
Python, Jupyter Notebook,Google colab, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Gradio.
